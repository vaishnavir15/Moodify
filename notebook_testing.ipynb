    "Project: Song Recommendation System Based on User Mood\n",
    "This project aims to create a system that suggests songs based on a user's mood. We will use Spotify and Genius APIs to fetch user data, process this data to create embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model, store these embeddings in a FAISS index, and use LangChain and MLflow to manage the retrieval and generation processes.\n",

    " 1. Setup Environment and Install Dependencies\n",
    "**Why:** To ensure all necessary packages and tools are available for the project.\n",
    "**Action:** Install the required libraries such as `lyricsgenius`, `spotipy`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `faiss-cpu`, `tqdm`, and `mlflow`.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
