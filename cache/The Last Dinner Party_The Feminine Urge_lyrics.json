"30 ContributorsThe Feminine Urge Lyrics[Verse 1]\nA room at dusk\nMastering the art of lying still\nBreathe like a girl\n'Til my lungs fill\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, pull your boots up, boys\nAnd push me down\nI'm only here\nFor your entertainment\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks\nAll the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love\nHere comes the feminine urge, I know it so well\nTo nurture the wounds my mother held\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh ballerina, bend under the weight of it all\nAin't it fun to hold the world in your hands?\nDo you feel like a man when I can't talk back?\nDo you want me, or do you want control?\nFailure to commit to the role, I admit\nWas a failure you achieved on your own\nDo you want me to care when you just disappear?\nI can't win them all (I can't win them all)\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nRun 'til I fall\nHow I wish the trees would swallow me\nMake me a forest\nTake away my soul\nI could never give the curse to her\nI, I could never live with the guilt of lying\nThat people are kind\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks\nAll the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love\nHere comes the feminine urge, I know it so well\nTo nurture the wounds my mother held\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh ballerina, bend under the weight of it all\nAin't it fun to hold the world in your hands?\nDo you feel like a man when I can't talk back?\nDo you want me or do you want control?\nFailure to commit to the role, I admit\nWas a failure you achieved on your own\nDo you want me to care when you just disappear?\nI can't win them all (I can't win them all)\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a dark red liver (Ooh) stretched out on the rocks (Oh-oh-ooh)\nAll the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love (Ooh-oh-ooh-ooh)\nHere comes the feminine urge, I know it so well (Oh-oh-ooh)\nTo nurture the wounds my mother held\n[Outro]\nGive me that dark red liquor stretched out on the rocks\nAll the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love\nHere comes the feminine urge, I know it so well\nTo nurture the wounds my mother heldEmbed"
