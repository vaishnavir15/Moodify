"5 ContributorsLinger (SiriusXM Session) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf you, if you could return\nDon't let it burn, don't let it fade\nI'm sure l'm not being rude\nBut it's just your attitude\nAnd it's tearing me apart\nAnd it's ruining every day\nOh, I swore, I swore I would be true\nAnd, honey, so did you\nSo why were you holding her hand?\nIs it just the way we stand?\nWere you lying all the time?\nWas it just a game to you?\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm in so deep\nYou know I'm such a fool for you\nYou got me wrapped around your finger\nDo you have to let it linger?\nDo you have to, do you have to\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I thought the world of you\nI thought nothing could go wrong\nBut I was wrong, I was wrong\nIf you, if you could get by\nTrying not to lie\nOh, things wouldn't be so confused\nAnd I wouldn't feel so used\nBut you always really knew\nI just wanna be with you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd I'm in so deep\nYou know I'm such a fool for you\nYou got me wrapped around your finger\nDo you have to let it linger?\nDo you have to, do you have to\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know I'm such a fool for you\nYou got me wrapped around your finger\nDo you have to let it linger?\nDo you have to, do you have to\nDo you have to let it linger?Embed"
