"12 ContributorsThe Archer Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe earth went ahead\nAnd shook itself apart the very moment I laid eyes on you\nI\u2005took\u2005some pleasure at\u2005the burning of the cross before\nAnd\u2005heaven couldn't be so true\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ate me right up\nYou spit me back out\nYou bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth\nI licked the blood from your lips\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't need to tell you but your arrow's made of stars\nAnd the shot that you've made punctured straight into my heart\nIt's a little ignorant but everybody's saying that forever is the place where you and I were made\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ate me right up\nYou spit me back out\nYou bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth\nI licked the blood from your lips\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ate me right up\nYou spit me back out\nYou bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth\nAnd I licked the blood from your lipsYou might also like2Embed"
