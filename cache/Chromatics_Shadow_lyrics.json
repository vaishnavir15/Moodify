"14 ContributorsShadow Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShadow, take me down\nShadow, take me down with you\nFor the last time, for the last time\nFor the last time, for the last time\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're in the water, I'm standing on the shore\nStill thinking that I hear your voice\nCan you hear me, can you hear me?\nCan you hear me, can you hear me?\n\n[Chorus]\nFor the last time, for the last time\nFor the last time, for the last time\n\n[Verse 3]\nAt night I'm driving in your car\nPretending that we'll leave this town\nWe're watching all the street lights fade\nAnd now you're just a stranger's dream\nI took your picture from the frame\nAnd now you're nothing like you seem\nYour shadow fell like last night's rain\n\n[Chorus]\nFor the last time, for the last time\nFor the last time, for the last timeYou might also like6Embed"
