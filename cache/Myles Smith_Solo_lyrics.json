"7 ContributorsSolo Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou promised a lifetime but left in a moment\nI wonder if you even think about me\nThrow me a lifeline 'cause I'm barely floating\nStranded and broken\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou know you got me lost in the dark\nIs it too late? Is it too late for us?\nYou know you got me lost in my heart\nIs it too late? Is it too late for us?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leave me so low? To leave me solo?\nOh, I was wasting my time\nHoping you'd call, but damn, you're so cold\nOh, why'd you make me feel safe\nJust to walk away? Just to let me go?\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leav\u0435 me so low? To leave m\u0435 solo?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou looked like an angel, thought I was in heaven\nBut now I'm just falling without you with me\nI thought I was able to learn from my lessons\nWas trying my best but\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nYou know you got me lost in the dark\nIs it too late? Is it too late for us?\nYou know you got me lost in my heart\nIs it too late? Is it too late for us?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leave me so low? To leave me solo?\nOh, I was wasting my time\nHoping you'd call, but damn, you're so cold\nOh, why'd you make me feel safe\nJust to walk away? Just to let me go?\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leave me so low? To leave me solo?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh-ooh, ooh\nI'll never love again, I'll never love again\nOh-ooh, ooh\nI'll never love again, I'll never love again\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leave me so low? To leave me solo?\nOh, I was wasting my time\nHoping you'd call, but damn, you're so cold\nOh, why'd you make me feel safe\nJust to walk away? Just to let me go?\nOh, why'd you get me so high\nTo leave me so low? To leave me solo?Embed"
