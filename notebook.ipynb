    "Project: Song Recommendation System Based on User Mood\n",
    "This project aims to create a system that suggests songs based on a user's mood. We will use Spotify and Genius APIs to fetch user data, process this data to create embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model, store these embeddings in a FAISS index, and use LangChain and MLflow to manage the retrieval and generation processes.\n",
    " Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Setup Environment and Install Dependencies\n",
    "**Why:** To ensure all necessary packages and tools are available for the project.\n",
    "**Action:** Install the required libraries such as `lyricsgenius`, `spotipy`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `faiss-cpu`, `tqdm`, and `mlflow`.\n",
